```ts
app.use(compression())
```

`compression()` is a middleware function provided by the `compression` library in Node.js. When added as middleware in an application, it compresses the response bodies of HTTP requests made to the server. This helps to reduce the amount of data transferred between the server and client, resulting in faster responses and lower bandwidth usage.

`The compression()` middleware automatically compresses response bodies for all requests that pass through it, based on the client's Accept-Encoding header. It supports gzip, deflate, and brotli compression algorithms, and will choose the best one based on the client's capabilities.
