```ts
app.getHttpAdapter()
```

In this code snippet, `app.getHttpAdapter() `is being called to obtain a reference to the underlying HTTP server adapter used by the NestJS application. This reference can be useful for testing, as it allows you to make requests directly to the server without going through the network stack.

End-to-end (e2e) testing is a type of testing that involves testing the entire application from end to end, as if you were a user interacting with it. In the context of a NestJS application, this might involve making HTTP requests to the application and verifying that the responses are correct.

By obtaining a reference to the HTTP server adapter, you can write tests that make requests directly to the server without starting up the entire application. This can be faster and more efficient than running full integration tests that start up the entire application, since it allows you to isolate the code you want to test.
