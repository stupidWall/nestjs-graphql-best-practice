In NestJS, `app.enableShutdownHooks()` is a method that enables the application to handle process signals and gracefully shut down the application when it receives a signal.

When you call `app.enableShutdownHooks()` in your NestJS application, it sets up a listener for the `SIGTERM` signal, which is a signal that is sent to a process to request termination. If the application receives this signal, it will execute the `close()` method on the `NestApplication` instance, which shuts down the HTTP server and any active connections.

Enabling shutdown hooks is important for gracefully shutting down your NestJS application, especially in production environments where you want to avoid killing the process abruptly. By shutting down the application gracefully, you allow it to perform any necessary cleanup tasks and close any open connections before exiting.


##### `terminus`

First, let's install the `@nestjs/terminus` package, which provides a set of tools for gracefully shutting down NestJS applications:
```
npm install @nestjs/terminus
```

Next, let's modify the `main.ts` file in our NestJS application to use `TerminusModule` and handle the `onShutdown()` event:
```ts
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';
import { TerminusModule } from '@nestjs/terminus';

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);

  // Register the TerminusModule to handle shutdown events
  app.register(TerminusModule.forRoot({
    // Define a health check endpoint that always returns a 200 status code
    endpoints: [ { url: '/health', healthIndicators: [] } ],
    // Define a set of cleanup tasks to perform before shutting down
    async onShutdown() {
      // Close any active database connections
      await app.get('DatabaseService').close();
      // Write a log message indicating that the application has shut down
      console.log('Application shut down');
    }
  }));

  // Start the HTTP server
  await app.listen(3000);
}
bootstrap();
```

In this example, we're using `TerminusModule` to define a health check endpoint and a set of cleanup tasks to perform before shutting down the application. The `endpoints` array defines a health check endpoint that always returns a 200 status code. The `onShutdown()` callback is called when the application receives a `SIGTERM` signal or is shut down programmatically.

In the `onShutdown()` callback, we're using the `app.get()` method to retrieve an instance of a `DatabaseService` class and call its `close()` method to close any active database connections. We're also writing a log message to the console to indicate that the application has shut down.

By using `TerminusModule` and handling the `onShutdown()` event, we can gracefully shut down our NestJS application and perform any necessary cleanup tasks before exiting.
