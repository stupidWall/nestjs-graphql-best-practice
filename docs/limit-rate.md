```ts
app.use(
    rateLimit({
        windowMs: 1000 * 60 * 60, // an hour
        max: RATE_LIMIT_MAX, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
        message:
            '⚠️  Too many request created from this IP, please try again after an hour'
    })
)
```

This code snippet is setting up rate limiting middleware for the NestJS application using the `rate-limit` library.

The middleware will limit the number of requests that can be made to the server by a single IP address within a specified time window, in this case, one hour.

The `windowMs` property specifies the length of the time window in milliseconds, and the max property sets the maximum number of requests allowed within that time window.

If a client exceeds the rate limit, they will receive an error message specified in the message property. In this case, the message tells the client that they have made too many requests from their IP address and they should try again after an hour.

By using rate limiting middleware, the server can prevent malicious or unintentional attacks such as denial-of-service attacks or brute-force attacks by limiting the number of requests from a single IP address.
