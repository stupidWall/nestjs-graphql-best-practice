```ts
app.use(helmet())
```

`helmet` is a collection of middleware functions for securing a Node.js web application by setting various HTTP headers

It helps to protect the application from common web vulnerabilities by adding a layer of security to HTTP responses.


When `app.use(helmet())` is called, it applies a set of middleware functions provided by `helmet` to the application. These middleware functions set various HTTP headers on the responses to improve their security.


Some of the headers set by helmet middleware functions include:

- `X-XSS-Protection`: helps to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by enabling the browser's XSS protection mechanism.
- `X-Frame-Options`: helps to prevent clickjacking attacks by controlling how the application can be embedded in a page.
- `Content-Security-Policy`: helps to prevent various types of attacks (such as cross-site scripting and code injection) by restricting the sources from which certain types of content can be loaded.
- `Strict-Transport-Security`: helps to enforce HTTPS usage by telling the browser to only use secure connections for a period of time after visiting the site.

By adding `helmet()` middleware to a NestJS application, it becomes more secure and better protected against common web vulnerabilities.
